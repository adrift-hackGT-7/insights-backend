# Insights-Backend

> Backend API that crowdsources sales, staffing, and catalog data from a network of non-competing small businesses (in the same sector) to provide actionable insights that benefit all member businesses. Created for the NCR challenge at HackGT 2020. Built using Python, Docker, Flask, Pandas, and Numpy.

## â„¹ About

This is where the math magic happens for the Small Business Insights Dashboard. We use a month-over-month algorithm to calculate the best selling products, worst selling products, profit and revenue insights, as well as suggestions on whether to increase or decrease staffing based on performance. We make use of NCR's Catalog API to store the data of products sold so as to have uniformity among records collected.

We aim to help small businesses to grow and the best way to enable this is to learn from other businesses concurrently. Although two businesses might be competitors, they have a lot to learn from each other. The algorithm takes into account other business insights and recommends products and staff numbers once a small business chooses to opt into this program.
